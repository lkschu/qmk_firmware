# CRKBD keymap

a keymap for the crkbd/Corne keyboard intended for systems using the us-international keyboard layout.

For general adwise on how to use this please visit [qmk-newbs].




## Modifying this layout
 - [alloyui] features a usefull colorpicker to convert rgb into hsv, however hsv on the website is limited by 360Â°,100%,100% and not by 255,255,255 so this would have to be calculated manually. Hue is still a bit off most of the time.
 - [qmk-keycodes] lists all available keycodes.


if special keys are needed, the can be added by modifying **keymap.c** like this:

define the names of the keycodes

```C
enum custom_keycodes {
    TEST1,
    TEST2,
    EURO,
};
```

then handle them at the end like this:

```C
bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
    /* This function gets called before the actual handling is done!
     * Return true if normal handling should continue, else return false */
    switch (keycode) {
        case TEST1:
            return false; // do nothing here
            break;

        case EURO:
            if (record->event.pressed) {
                //on pressed key
                SEND_STRING("str");
            } else {
                //on release
                SEND_STRING("release");
            }
            return false; //replace this char
            break;

        default:
            if (record->event.pressed) {
                set_keylog(keycode, record);
            }
            return true; //let qmk handle the keycode
            break;
    }
}
```

 - [qmk-rgb-matrix] tells you everything you need to know about the rgb matrix system.



## Expanding this layout
 - [quantum-functions] describes many usefull functions which are getting called on init, sleep, etc.
 - [feature-layers] explain which special layer functionallity can be used. LED matrix is defined in [this file][https://github.com/lkschu/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/crkbd/rev1/rev1.c]. First it defines the mapping key<->led (these are not all leds!). Then it defines a list of coordinates, each corresponding to 1 led (these are all leds). Then it defines a list of flags, which declare the role of the given led(by index). Roles like normal=4,underglow=2 or modifiers=1.
 - [rgblight](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight) this might also be usefull
